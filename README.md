# Pokemon-Demo
## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to create a C++ application to test game development. As the name of the repo suggests, this game is based on Pokemon (specifically Pokemon Emerald). On top of using C++ to learn how to build Pokemon mechanics from scratch, the repo also explores how to build a custom game engine instead of relying on popular game engines like Unity and Unreal for game development.

## Project Inspiration
This project was inspired by Progrematic's [YouTube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R5vSIZxr0M) on designing a Flappy Bird game, which I consulted to design the game engine. His GitHub repo for the Flappy Bird game can be found [here](https://github.com/progrematic/LetsMakeAGame). Currently, the game engine uses GLFW to help with Window management, and SOIL for image handling.

## Project Demos
Demos for the project can be found on YouTube.
